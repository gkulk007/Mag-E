## What is Mag-E? 
We all know that participating in events, cultural activities, and webinars taken by college is as important as studies. Our college is regularly doing all these activities for students. Investing their time in such activities is always beneficial for them.

But many a times it seems that many students are unaware of all these things or may get information of all these a little late. So they cannot participate with full preparation.

So by taking this in consideration we are creating an E-magazine for it which contains all the information like events, its time table, information of past events for reference and many more.


However the site is still under constant development whether it is adding more features, fixing bugs, improving performance, adding styling and making it more responsive and much more. So the site is great at the moment and it can be made even more incredible with active development.
